Alzheimer's Disease early stage analyst using Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by short-term memory loss, paranoia, and delusional thoughts often mistaken for signs of stress or aging and there is currently no definitive medical cure. Continuous medication is necessary for managing AD, which is a chronic condition lasting for years or even a lifetime. It's crucial to administer medication at the appropriate stage to minimize brain damage.

In the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease, individuals can typically function independently, engaging in daily activities such as work, driving, and socializing. However, they may experience occasional memory lapses, such as difficulty recalling familiar words or names, which may be noticed by those close to them. Early-stage challenges include:

1. Difficulty recalling the right words or names.
2. Struggling to remember names when meeting new people.
3. Challenges in social or work settings due to memory issues.
4. Forgetfulness, such as misplacing objects or forgetting recently read information.
5. Difficulty planning or organizing tasks and activities
